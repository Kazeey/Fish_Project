# Fish_Project

This is a project i made few years ago, when i was stil learning OOP.

## Goal 
This project was made for an aquarium in France, so this how it works :
- An aquariologists scan the RFID tag in a fish,
- The data is sended to a C++ App per RS232,
- Then the data is processed and stored in a database,
- The first website, display the last scanned fish to the public, with some ,informations, like name, location, or species,
- And the second website allow the use to see some stats like
    - The last dish of the fish, 
    - How many times did he got feed, 
    - How many fishes of this species, 
    - Some charts,
    - Etc ...

## Websites
In this repository there is the both website that i did, developped in vanilla PHP (i would probably use something else now, and merge the two sites to be honest ...), using Bootstrap, Materialize, and JQuery.

## Database
There is also the database file, if you want to try to run it, with all the specified option in the files.
